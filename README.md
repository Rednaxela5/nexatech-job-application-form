# Acknowledgements

* [Parth Jadhav](https://github.com/ParthJadhav) and his [contributors](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer/graphs/contributors) for their awesome [Tkinter-Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer). This project would look dull if we used the common tkinter. So thank you very much for this helpful project.
* [Mohit Yadav](https://github.com/Just-Moh-it) for his [HotinGo](https://github.com/Just-Moh-it/HotinGo) project. Learned a lot from his approach in making README.md as well as the whole project.
* [raja2505](https://github.com/raja2505) for his [Name Patcher](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer/issues/345). Made renaming elements and editing code a lot faster.
